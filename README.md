## Why Use This Project?

- **Ultra Fast & Cost-Effective:** Optimized for Replicate.com and GPU/CPU environments, delivering rapid results at minimal cost.
- **Highly Customizable:** Choose your model, device, and audio preprocessing level. Fine-tune for your use case—call centers, interviews, podcasts, meetings, and more.
- **Advanced Audio Treatment:** Built-in options for sanitization, high/low-pass filtering, aggressive noise reduction, and RMS normalization. Tame even the worst audio!
- **Stereo Channel Support:** Perfect for call center recordings—transcribes each channel separately for maximum speaker accuracy.
- **Multi-Input Flexibility:** Accepts direct file upload, URL, or base64 string. Integrate easily with any workflow.
- **Speaker Diarization & Transcription:** State-of-the-art Whisper and Pyannote models for accurate speech-to-text and speaker separation.
- **Translation & Language Detection:** Auto-detects language and can translate speech to English for global applications.
- **Scalable & Production-Ready:** Designed for batch processing, API integration, and large-scale deployments.

## Input Parameters

- `file_string: str`: Either provide a Base64 encoded audio file.
- `file_url: str`: Or provide a direct audio file URL.
- `file: Path`: Or provide an audio file.
- `num_speakers: int`: Number of speakers. Leave empty to autodetect. Must be between 1 and 50.
- `translate: bool`: Translate the speech into English.
- `language: str`: Language of the spoken words as a language code like 'en'. Leave empty to auto detect language.
- `prompt: str`: Vocabulary: provide names, acronyms, and loanwords in a list. Use punctuation for best accuracy. Also now used as 'hotwords' paramater in transcribing,
- `preprocess: int`: Audio preprocessing level:
  - 0 → No preprocessing (raw audio).
  - 1 → Sanitization only (mono, 16kHz, PCM).
  - 2 → Sanitization + Filtering (highpass & lowpass).
  - 3 → Sanitization + Filtering + Noise reduction.
  - 4 → Sanitization + Filtering + Noise reduction + Normalization.
- `highpass_freq: int`: High-pass filter frequency in Hz (removes low frequencies below this value).
- `lowpass_freq: int`: Low-pass filter frequency in Hz (removes high frequencies above this value).
- `prop_decrease: float`: Noise reduction intensity (0.0 to 1.0), where 1.0 is most aggressive.
- `stationary: bool`: If True, assumes noise is stationary (constant background noise).
- `target_dBFS: float`: Target loudness level for RMS normalization (e.g., -18.0).
  
## Output

- `segments: List[Dict]`: List of segments with speaker, start and end time.
  - Includes `avg_logprob` for each segment and `probability` for each word level segment.
- `num_speakers: int`: Number of speakers (detected, unless specified in input).
- `language: str`: Language of the spoken words as a language code like 'en' (detected, unless specified in input).

### Notes & Tips
The higher the noise reduction level, the more vocal characteristics are lost, which can make diarization harder.
(This is why upcoming updates will support channel-based speaker separation.)

Noise reduction is mainly used to improve pause-time detection. Sometimes, background noise can cause incorrect timestamps.

## Ideal Use Cases

- **Call Centers:** Stereo channel separation for agent/customer
- **Meetings & Interviews:** Multi-speaker diarization
- **Podcasts & Broadcasts:** Clean transcription from noisy sources
- **VoIP & Low-Quality Audio:** Advanced noise handling
